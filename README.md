# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to perform comprehensive analysis on a world dataset and leverage the power of data visualization to derive meaningful insights. By exploring various socio-economic indicators across different countries, the project aimed to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that could inform strategic decision-making and drive impactful actions.
Through the creation of interactive reports and visually engaging dashboards, the project sought to provide stakeholders with a clear and intuitive understanding of key metrics such as GDP, CO2 emissions, life expectancy, and more.
